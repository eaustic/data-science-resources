### About these resources

- The aim of this repository is to share free, open source, and [open science](http://openhardware.science/) learning resources that may be helpful to beginning- and intermediate-level data scientist in-training. If a tutorial or book is only available by purchase or subscription, that will be noted - otherwise you may assume the resource is free and open source.
