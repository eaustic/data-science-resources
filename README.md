#### About these resources

- I created this repository on _April 15, 2017_. Over time, I will slowly be adding learning resources to each sub-folder and readme file.
- The emphasis will be on sharing free, open source, and [open science](http://openhardware.science/) learning resources. If a tutorial or book is only available by purchase or subscription, that will be noted - otherwise you may assume it is free to access.
