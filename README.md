# Data Science Resources

- This is a repository of select resources for those new to data science.
- Resources are organized by topic within the sub-folders above. 
- Links to other, external resources are provided in the readme docs within each sub-folder.
- I created this repository on _April 15, 2017_. Over time, I will slowly be adding a limited number of links and other resources related to each of the data science topics listed above.
- All resources are free or open source unless otherwise noted. The emphasis will be on sharing free / non-subscription-based learning resources.
