### About these resources

- The emphasis will be on sharing free, open source, and [open science](http://openhardware.science/) learning resources accessible to a beginning- or intermediate-level data-scientist-in-training. If a tutorial or book is only available by purchase or subscription, that will be noted - otherwise you may assume the resource is free to access.
