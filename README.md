# Data Science Resources
## This is a repository of select resources for those new to data science.

# How resources are organized
- Resources are organized by topic within the sub-folders above. 
- Links to other, external resources are provided in the readme docs within each sub-folder.

# About these resources
- I created this repository on _April 15, 2017_. Over time, I will slowly be adding a limited number of links and other resources related to each of the data science topics listed above.
- All resources are free unless otherwise noted. The emphasis will be on sharing free, open source, and [open science](http://openhardware.science/) learning resources.
