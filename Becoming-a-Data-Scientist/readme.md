### Books about becoming data scientists (interviews with data scientists)
- [Data Scientists at Work](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Scientists-Work-Sebastian-Gutierrez/dp/1430265981) 
- [The Data Science Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Handbook-Insights-Scientists/dp/0692434879/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1492321697&sr=1-2&keywords=The+data+science+handbook)

### Key web sites for networking with other data scientists
- [Data Science Central](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/)
- Search [Meetup.com](meetup.com) for local meetup groups focusing on data science and related topics like Python programming
- Search Google for your regional "big data" hub - e.g., [The Midwest Big Data Hub](http://midwestbigdatahub.org/), as well as working groups based on themes within your hub, e.g., [Midwest Working Groups](http://midwestbigdatahub.org/about/working-groups/)

### Data science conferences and symposiums
- Search for conferences and symposiums representing a cross-section between data science and the topics you are most passionate about, such as [Open Science](http://openhardware.science/). Also, keep in mind that local symposiums can provide a great place to network for jobs even if they are small (and are usually much less expensive to attend).
